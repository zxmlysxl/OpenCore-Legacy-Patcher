# OpenCore-Patcher Update Shim

To handle the new PKG installation method, old versions of OpenCore Legacy Patcher updating to newer versions will still require 'OpenCore-Patcher.app' to be available for download.

Thus the goal of this app is to install an embedded PKG under ./OpenCore-Patcher.app/Contents/Resources/OpenCore-Patcher.pkg to handle the update process.
