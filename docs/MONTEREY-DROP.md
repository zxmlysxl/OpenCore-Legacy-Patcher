With OpenCore Legacy Patcher v0.1.7 and newer, we've implemented beta macOS Monterey support for users. Please note that Apple has dropped a lot of hardware with this release as well as broken many of our previous patch sets. This page will be used to inform users regarding current issues and will be updated as new patch sets are developed and added to our patcher.

## Newly dropped hardware

With Monterey, Apple continues their their somewhat ruthless march of dropping Intel hardware. This release saw the removal, and thus addition into OpenCore Legacy Patcher, of the following models:

* iMac14,4
* iMac15,1
* MacBook8,1
* MacBookAir6,1
* MacBookAir6,2
* MacBookPro11,1
* MacBookPro11,2
* MacBookPro11,3

::: details Model names

* iMac (21.5-inch, Mid 2014)
* iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, Late 2014)
* MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015)
* MacBook Air (11-inch, Mid 2013)
* MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013)

All of these models now have support in OpenCore Legacy Patcher.

## Current Monterey Issues

### MacBookPro11,3 booting issue without Kepler acceleration

Due to the display being routed through the NVIDIA Kepler card and macOS being rendered on the Intel iGPU, users have been experiencing issues booting without post-install patches applied ([see here for more info](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/issues/522).) Currently the only workaround is to install the patches in safe mode, by holding down `Shift+Enter` when you select macOS in the OCLP boot picker.

::: details macOS 12.0 Beta 4 issue on 2012 to early 2013 machines (Resolved in 0.2.5 and newer)

Currently in macOS 12.0 Beta 4, many Ivy Bridge Macs have experienced Bluetooth issues relating to their BCM20702 chipset. Currently the exact issue is unknown however is assumed to be a bug on Apple's end. Recommend downgrading to macOS 12.0 Beta 3 till resolved:

* [12.0 Beta 3 (21A5284e) InstallAssistant (archive.org)](https://archive.org/details/12.0-21a5284e-beta-3)

A temporary fix is to restart the BlueTool and bluetoothd process with each boot, note it may not work for all users:

```sh
sudo killall -9 BlueTool bluetoothd
```
