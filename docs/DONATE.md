# Supporting the patcher

We have opened OpenCollective in order to manage donations as well as be transparent about where the donated money is going. If you want to support the patcher with money donation, you can do so below.

If you wish, you can also donate legacy hardware you don't need anymore as long as it makes sense logistically. In this case, reach out on the Discord server.
