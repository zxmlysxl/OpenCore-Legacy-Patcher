# What is OpenCore?

OpenCore is a sophisticated boot loader used to inject and patch data in memory, instead of on disk. This means that we're able to achieve a near-native experience on many unsupported Macs. 

We recommend viewing the [OpenCore Patcher Terminology Page](./TERMS.md) if you have questions.

For troubleshooting, see our troubleshooting pages below or join the [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server.](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN)

## How do I get started?

1. Read the [FAQ](./FAQ.md) for application requirements and other information.
2. Check that your model is supported from the [Supported Models](./MODELS.md) page.
3. Once you've verified your model is supported, you can jump into the process in [Download and build macOS Installer](./INSTALLER.md)
