# How to debug with OpenCore

For those who've hit an odd bug and are unsure if it's user error or within the patcher, we recommend asking on the [OpenCore Patcher Paradise Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rqdPgH8xSN) for help.

## Debugging yourself

The easiest way to debug yourself is via Patcher Settings. Here there are many different settings, however, the 3 main options that will help are:

* "Enable Verbose Mode"
* "Enable OpenCore DEBUG"
* "Enable Kext DEBUG"

When you've enabled these 3 options, rebuild OpenCore and install to your drive. This will provide much greater debug information as well as write logs to the EFI Partition.

## Obtaining OpenCore logs from disk

With "Enable OpenCore DEBUG" set, on every boot there will be a .txt file generated on the EFI Partition. To grab these logs, [download and run MountEFI](https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI):

Once you've mounted the EFI Partition of the drive you have macOS on, you should see some nice logs:

## Obtaining Kernel logs from macOS

With "Enable Kext DEBUG" set, every boot will now have much more detailed logs stored in the OS. To get these logs, simply run the below command:

```sh
sudo dmesg > ~/Desktop/DMESG.txt
```

From there, you'll have a log on your desktop.
